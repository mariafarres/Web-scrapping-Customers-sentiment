# Web scrapping to run a sentiment analysis toward phone devices (BIG DATA)

**Project goal:** run a sentiment analysis for mobile devices by counting words associated with sentiment appearing within relevant documents on the web. Then, leverage this data to look for patterns in the documents that enable us to label each of these documents with a value that represents the level of positive or negative sentiment toward each of the selected devices. 

**Data characteristics:**  a cloud computing platform provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) is used to conduct the analysis; the data sets analyzed come from Common Crawl.
